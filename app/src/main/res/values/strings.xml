        This operator is really great for button clicks. If a user presses a button too many times,
        there is  no need to execute the action several times over. We can use the Debounce operator
        to throttle back their clicks by introducing an allowable timespan between clicks. If the
        timespan has not elapsed, we can inhibit any methods from being called twice.
